This is borderline off-topic, but the app is software and design decisions around the route to market for software is close enough for me to put it here.<br /><br />I've downloaded the Ordnance Survey app for the iPad. For non-UK readers, the Ordnance Survey produce some of the world's best mapping examples, covering the whole of mainland Britain at 1:25,000 scale which basically shows every building. For anyone who does any walking in the countryside these are brilliant. We've got tons of the paper ones.<br /><br />The app's pretty nice - performs well, lets you do routes. However, it suffers from two fatal business decisions:<br /><h3>Content is over-priced</h3><div><br /></div><h3>Content is non-transferable</h3><div><br /></div>
