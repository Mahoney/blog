In the wake of the new Apple iPhone licensing agreement that seeks to restrict development to C, C++, Objective-C and JavaScript I read <a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/posts/apple-is-just-microsoft-with-better-marketing/">this post on the Enfranchised Mind</a> and wanted to chime in in support and with my own take on what programming languages are all about, particularly after reading some of the frightening misunderstandings on Apple fan forums.<br /><br />Firstly, it's important to distinguish between languages and platforms.  Flash is a platform - a runtime that allows arbitrary third party logic to run.  ActionScript is just a language, text files - no use without an interpreter or a compiler.  There's similar confusion about Java, partly Sun's fault - Java-the-JVM is a platform/runtime, but Java-the-language is again just a set of rules about how you write logic in text files.<br /><br />The role of a compiler is to take these text files and translate them.  The compiler may translate them into something the underlying platform can understand, or into an intermediate language like Java bytecode that a runtime like the JVM can understand and translate on the fly to the underlying platform.<br /><br />I have some sympathy with Apple not wanting the JVM or Flash on the iPhone.  They want to control (via the App Store) the manner in which all logic which runs on the iPhone gets there.  If they allow a different runtime on it is highly likely to allow a mechanism to run arbitrary logic on the phone.  It would also place them in a quandary - they either take on the burden of working with the platform to ensure it delivers a good user experience, or are at the mercy of the platforms' use and exposure of their APIs.<br /><br />What is crazy, however, is to try and tie down the language used to develop for the iPhone.  The iPhone doesn't understand C or C++ or Objective-C or JavaScript.  It understands 1s and 0s.  To get logic written in those languages into a state where the iPhone can run it requires it to be compiled (or interpreted)<br /><br />Here's an analogy - the platform (say the iPhone) speaks Mandarin (i.e. direct processor instructions).  Programmers speak English (i.e. Java).  Let's consider two ways to allow the iPhone to "read" a book written by one of those programmers:<br /><ol><li>the book itself is translated from English into Mandarin</li><li>the book is translated into an intermediate language (say Latin). An interpreter who speaks Latin &amp; Mandarin walks around with the iPhone and interprets to it on the fly<br /></li></ol>
