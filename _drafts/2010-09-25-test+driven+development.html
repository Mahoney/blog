<p>I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3591108/what-cant-be-solved-by-tdd">this discussion on Stack Overflow</a> via DZone and a couple of the comments, and discussions when interviewing people, made me want to clarify my thoughts on TDD.</p><p>The comments were: <ul><li>[TDD] Can't address poor or incomplete requirements.</li><li>[TDD] cannot replace functional and intergation tests.</li></ul></p><p>Testing is about validating the contract of an interface - given a state, when a particular thing happens</p>
