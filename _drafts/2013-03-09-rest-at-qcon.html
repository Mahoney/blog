I've just spent three days thoroughly enjoying myself at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon 2013</a>. In the process I attended some talks on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> which I found interesting and challenging.<br /><br />The first was <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Web%20Development:%20You're%20Doing%20it%20Wrong">"Web Development: You're Doing it Wrong"</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/stilkov">Stefan Tilkov</a>. He was taking aim at two trends in web development. Fairly uncontroversially he was saying that server-side component based web frameworks like old school <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces">JSF</a> which are heavily stateful are a bad idea. More controversially he was arguing that client side component based web frameworks, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Applications</a>, such as those one might make with <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> or <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> are essentially making the same mistake just shifting it to the client. He was arguing that we should be embracing the things that HTTP and the browser gives us for free, like the forward &amp; back buttons, URIs that identify exactly where we are and are able to be bookmarked / passable around, and the possibility for people on less capable clients (right down to Lynx or Curl) to still be able to interact fully with the application.<br /><br />These principles are expressed in the <a href="http://roca-style.org/">ROCA (Resource Oriented Client Architecture)</a> style recommendations that he's heavily involved with.<br /><br />I hope he wouldn't view it as a misrepresentation to say that he was taking the principles of REST for machine to machine communication and applying them to web applications. Which made it interesting to then hear <br /><br /><br />* It seems very old school - but github are doing it well!<br />* Love the idea that the browser is just a REST client operating on text/html with a human driver - human and computer using fundamentally the same API; same resources, same names, same operations.<br />* Browser cannot PUT or DELETE<br />* Back button and POST - not happy. 302 after POST that POST/PUT/DELETE is not HTTP compliant.<br />* Logic on client is inevitable and desirable<br />* Working offline...<br />* Extra work compared to speed you can knock up a single page application with a fairly dumb server
