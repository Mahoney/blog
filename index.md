# So What's All This Then?

I'm Robert Elliot; a London based programmer working predominantly on websites
built on the JVM since 2000.

After reading one too many CVs that took two pages over telling me little more
than that the writer had spent a decade in the industry doing all the sorts of
things that anyone who had been developing on the JVM for a decade was bound to
have done, and consequently having no idea how to choose between them, I thought
I'd try doing something a little different.

I'm going to try here to give an idea of what it would be like to employ me. So
I'll tell you not just what I've done and what I've used, but also what I
thought about it, and consequently what I'd be likely to use or advocate if I
were working for you. Hopefully it will give you more of a sense of whether or
not you'd want to employ me than another "I used best practices as part of a
team to deliver a website using Spring & Hibernate" CV.

So here you can read about the [my past projects](/past_projects/), the
[technologies](/technologies/) and [processes](/processes/) I've used, my
preferred [architectural approaches](/architecture/), how I view the vital
business of [testing](/testing/) and my contributions to
[open source](/open_source/).

One quick caveat: whilst conveying my opinions is in many ways the point of this
site, I'd like to emphasise that I'm a great believer in holding mere opinions
lightly. Anything that doesn't have rigorous scientific evidence to back it up
is liable to change as experience & reality continue to educate me.
