<p>It could just be me but there's quite a strong association in my mind between Agile development methodologies and dynamic, weakly typed languages - particularly Ruby and Groovy, though again that's possibly skewed by personal experience.</p><p>At one level I can see it - more power can indeed sometimes allow you to produce business value faster.  There's also the testing angle; dynamic languages are peculiarly associated with rigorous unit testing in part because you really can't afford not to, as the compiler isn't going to catch a lot of programming errors.</p><p>At another level, however, it seems to me that a mature, strongly typed, static language is actually much more in tune with my understanding at least of Agile values &amp; principles.  Fast feedback is a major part of the way the teams I've worked on do Agile - we release weekly so that new features are in front of the customers as soon as possible so we can evaluate whether they were a good idea or not.  We integrate continuously and run automated regression tests to discover bugs fast.  We do short (<=3 day) stories so that the results can be in front of the business as soon as possible.  We slice our stories so that QA are looking at functional portions of them before they are complete.  We test drive from the top down using functional tests and then unit tests to find out as early as possible what errors there might be in our code.  It's all about keeping the feedback loop as tight as possible.</p><p>And here's where it seems to me a strongly typed, static language like Java can be <i>more</i> "agile" - because a good IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ will give a much, much faster feedback loop on basic programming errors than running unit tests.  Yes, there are ways that you can speed up the running of tests (though sadly it looks like JUnit Max has not seen wide enough adoption to keep it going) but they still aren't going to be up there for speed with the automated test (for that is what it is) that is a background compiler checking your code for correctness.</p><p>Then of course there are the other benefits of a strong type system to an Agile way of working.  The code is the documentation - it should be so good, the abstraction levels so clear and well named that you don't need anything else to tell you how to use it.  What could be more in keeping with that than compiler checked (and therefore guaranteed never to be out of date) documentation of the types expected and returned from a method?  (That, incidentally, has always seemed to me the primary benefit of generics - not that it saves you from programming errors that hardly anyone ever made, but that they document what you are expected to pass in that List argument or receive back in that Map in the 3rd party library you are using.)</p><p>In addition there's the straight forward speed of turning ideas into execution - a good IDE with code completion saves you even making that typo in the first place.  And it can suggest to you that method name you were pretty sure was on the class but can't quite remember (I was chatting the other day to someone who admitted to often strongly typing his groovy variables in order to get code completion from the IDE and then changing them back to def afterwards!)</p><p>Finally there's the limitations of tests.  It's possible to overestimate the safety given by rigorous unit testing.  Don't get me wrong, it's vital, and I'm not for a moment suggesting that a static, strongly typed language is a rationale for not writing rigorous unit tests; just that it is inherently impossible to write exhaustive tests that check every possible state and input, and hence impossible to be absolutely confident in the behaviour of a piece of code from its tests.  Static, strong typing helps here.  By enforcing the type of an argument it both saves you from writing some required tests and reduces the field of possible inputs that no-one could possibly test exhaustively.  Consider <a href="http://fantom.org/">Fantom's</a> null type system - by giving you absolute confidence as to that a method does not accept a null argument it saves both the caller from testing its behaviour when passed null and the writer of the method from writing a test for when null is passed in to document (and reassure himself!) as to what occurs.  Again I'd argue that the compiler is here acting as a low level unit test in itself that is proving some of the behaviour of your code for "free" - which speeds you up and adds quality.<br /></p><p>I wonder how far the dynamic/agile association is actually a result of the verbose nature of Java and its standard libraries?  Returning to it from Groovy you do notice quite how much extra boilerplate you are putting round simple ideas, and whilst that actual typing doesn't bother me much after years making it second nature the layer of obfuscation when I come to read it back a day/week/month later certainly does.  I've been reading and playing with Scala lately, and whilst I have some reservations (for a language that claims to be ridding us of Java's special cases it seems to have an awful lot of head spinning special cases of its own...) it does demonstrate how concise and powerful a static strongly typed language can be.</p><p>The problem as I see it at present for those like me who see real benefits in these features is that many of the benefits listed above are realised primarily in the presence of a really state of the art IDE.  My experience of IDE support for Fantom and Scala* (the Java++ flavours I find most appealing) is that it's a long, long way behind say Eclipse's Java support.  Which is unsurprising, but does I feel rather undermine their selling point.  The fact that their developers <span style="font-style: italic;">aren't</span> selling them (well, not for money at any rate) may be related to that!  Still, I feel that in a perfect world language and IDE development would go hand in hand.  Anyone up for developing a new language based on incrementally altering Eclipse's JDT?<br /></p>
