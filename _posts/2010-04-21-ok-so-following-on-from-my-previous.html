OK, so following on from my <a href="http://softwaredevthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/04/web-application-architecture-do-i.html">previous  blog post</a> I thought I'd do some performance testing to see how  Jetty compares with Apache.  Installed VirtualBox on my Mac, downloaded  and installed ubuntu 9.04 server edition with bridge networking so I  could access it from the host - all painless.  Installed apache2 -  painless.  Installed jmeter on the mac - painless.  Ran some performance  tests.<br /><br />Looked to repeat the experiment against Jetty - aargh!!  Just wasted 3 hours trying to work out why I couldn't connect to Jetty  from the host. Turns out that the documentation, in Debian/Ubuntu at  least, is wrong - when /etc/init.d/jetty claims that leaving JETTY_HOST  blank will result in accepting connections from all hosts it's lying.   You need to set it to 0.0.0.0 or it will only be accessible from  localhost (127.0.0.1). You can tell this because if you do a netstat -an  you will see this:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;"><pre><br />Proto               Local Address                          State</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">tcp6       0      0 127.0.0.1:8080 :::*                    LISTEN</pre></span><br /><br />that means the bind-address is localhost so the process is inaccessible outside the server.  It should look like this:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;"><pre><br />Proto               Local  Address  Foreign Address         State</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">tcp6       0      0 :::8080         :::*                    LISTEN</pre></span><br /><br />Hope this helps some other poor confused person out there, took me a long time to Google this... there's a Debian issue here:<br /><a class="linkification-ext" href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554874" title="Linkification: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554874">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554874</a>
