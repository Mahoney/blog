OK, so following on from my <a href="http://softwaredevthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/04/web-application-architecture-do-i.html">previou. blog post</a> I thought I'd do some performance testing to see ho. Jetty compares with Apache. Installed VirtualBox on my Mac, downloade. and installed ubuntu 9.04 server edition with bridge networking so . could access it from the host - all painless. Installed apache2 . painless. Installed jmeter on the mac - painless. Ran some performanc. tests.

Looked to repeat the experiment against Jetty - aargh!. Just wasted 3 hours trying to work out why I couldn't connect to Jett. from the host. Turns out that the documentation, in Debian/Ubuntu a. least, is wrong - when /etc/init.d/jetty claims that leaving JETTY_HOS. blank will result in accepting connections from all hosts it's lying.  You need to set it to 0.0.0.0 or it will only be accessible fro. localhost (127.0.0.1). You can tell this because if you do a netstat -a. you will see this:

<span style="font-family:courier new;"><pre>
Prot. . . . .  Local Addres. . . . . . . . . State</span>
<span style="font-family:courier new;">tcp. .   . .  0 127.0.0.1:8080 :::. . . . . . . LISTEN</pre></span>

that means the bind-address is localhost so the process is inaccessible outside the server. It should look like this:

<span style="font-family:courier new;"><pre>
Prot. . . . .  Loca. Addres. Foreign Addres. . .  State</span>
<span style="font-family:courier new;">tcp. .   . .  0 :::808. . .  :::. . . . . . . LISTEN</pre></span>

Hope this helps some other poor confused person out there, took me a long time to Google this... there's a Debian issue here:
